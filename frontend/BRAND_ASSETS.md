### Long (200 words)
Nexar is the next generation of payment platforms, built on Stellar blockchain and powered by artificial intelligence. We believe crypto payments should be as easy as sending a text message, not navigating complex wallet interfaces.

With Nexar, users interact through natural language: "Split 100 XLM in Family group" or "Send 50 USDC to @alice for design work." Our AI understands intent, handles the blockchain complexity, and executes transactions instantly on Stellar's fast, low-cost network.

Perfect for groups, Nexar automatically tracks shared expenses, suggests settlements, and generates professional receipts. Freelancers can invoice clients with a simple command. Friends can split dinner bills without awkward math. DAOs can manage treasury payments efficiently.
